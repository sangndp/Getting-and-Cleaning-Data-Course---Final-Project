# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course---Final-Project
The final project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course on Coursera.

The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (by UCI)

Files:

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called tidy_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
